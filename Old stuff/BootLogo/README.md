BootLogo
==========

Package to change Apple Grey Boot Logo (before the login screen)

1. Edit the logo.png to change the boot picture
2. Edit the third line of postinstall file to change the background color (or comment if you ant to keep the default grey)
3. Open BootLogo.pkgproj with Packages.app and Build it. (download Packages here : http://s.sudre.free.fr/Software/Packages/about.html )

NOTE : Logo doesn't display on some Mac, I don't know why for the moment. If you know why, send me a mail darkomen@me.com or a tweet : @darkomen78
